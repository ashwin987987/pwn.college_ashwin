Upon opening the WAV file, a few seconds into the music, Morse code starts playing and it plays throughout the rest of the audio.
The Morse code audio isn't easily decodable by online tools due to the audio being a bit distorted but on opening the audio and viewing its spectrogram in a program such as Audacity or Sonic Visualiser, the flag format citadel{ is visible at the 1:00 mark and the closing } at 1:12. This indicates the flag is the Morse code in between these timestamps.
The spectrogram gives a clear view of the flag now which is .----   .-.. ----- ...- ...--   .---- -.. -- or 1 L0V3 1DM
Also, the rest of the Morse code around the flag isn't really important, it decodes to:
# Flag: 
citadel{1_L0V3_1DM}
